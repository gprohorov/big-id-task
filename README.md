_Design and implement a simple Java program to find specific strings in a large text..._

Lines and position enumeration begins from 0 according to Java style.

Master branch was design without multi-threading  as a base variant.

This one implements ExecutorService in order to run each matcher in a separate thread.

BTW. The example in the documentation doesn't correspond to the real text file.
